### Unsolved Problems / Future Enhancements

This app is still in the early development stages, but functionality features users will be able to look forward to in the near future are viewing all of the transactions they enter as well as editing and/or deleting transactions.

A more thorough UI/UX redesign will also be implemented once the functionality features are completed and tested.

Specific features to be included will be:

- an auto-generated weekly report of income and expense transactions
- customizable notifications such as an alert for daily/weekly spending limit
